## EMUsort configuration file

# Dataset Parameters
# provide information specific to the dataset you want to sort
Data:
    dataset_type: 'openephys' # can be 'openephys', 'nwb', 'blackrock', 'intan' or 'binary'
    # below two settings are only used when 'openephys' dataset_type is chosen
    openephys_experiment_id: 0 # for openephys recordings with several experiment per session, zero indexing of the experiment to use (corresponds to "block_index" in spikeinterface)
    openephys_stream_id: 0 # for openephys recordings with several streams, zero indexing of the stream to use
    # below three settings are only used when 'binary' dataset_type is chosen
    binary_sampling_rate: # sampling rate of the emg data in binary file(s)
    binary_num_channels: # number of channels in the recording in binary file(s)
    binary_dtype: 'int16' # data type of the emg data in binary file(s)
    emg_recordings: [0] # index of each recording (zero indexing into file names of matching dataset_type in the session folder, sorted alphanumerically)
    # if multiple emg_recordings are chosen, they will be concatenated prior to sorting (can be [all] or a list of integers, e.g., [0,1,2,5,6])
    emg_passband: # low and high passband frequencies for emg data, in Hz
        - 250
        - 5000
    time_range: # start and end times to slice along time, set both to 0 to use all data
        - 0
        - 0

# Sorting Parameters
Sorting:
    output_folder: # if left blank, will output into the path provided by the session_folder argument
    GPU_to_use: [0] # GPU to use for kilosort, (a list of integers, e.g., [0,1,2,5,6])
    num_KS_jobs: 1 # number of Kilosort jobs to be distributed across all chosen GPUs (will run parallel jobs if >1)
    # If do_KS_param_sweep is True when num_KS_jobs = 1, it will perform the parameter sweep sequentially
    # If setting num_KS_jobs > 1, do_KS_param_sweep must be True
    do_KS_param_sweep: false # set to true to run multiple sorting jobs with different parameters. If true, the chosen parameters from the KS section will be overwritten 
    KS_params_to_sweep: # dictionary of Kilosort parameters to sweep, where each value must be a list, and each key must be a parameter in the KS section
        Th_universal: [9,10,7,5,2] # list of floats
        Th_learned: [8,4,3,2,1] # list of floats
        Th_single_ch: # list of lists of floats in units of STDs, EMUsort allows aggregation of multiple thresholds
            - [6, 9, 12, 15] # default setting for EMUsort
            - [6, 9, 12]
            - [3, 6, 9]
            - [6, 9]
            - [6]
    grouped_params_for_sweep: # list of lists of strings (parameter keys)
        # some parameters should be grouped to avoid bad combinations and reduce overall run count
        # each index of the parameter values are grouped as a single variable
        # for example, the first values of each key in a group are all taken together, and will not be combined with other indexes
        # leave blank to disable
            - [Th_universal,Th_learned]

# Channel Group Parameters
# channel groups are sorted individually (useful for separating sorting for multiple muscles),
# number of entries (rows) of each parameter define settings for each group
Group:
    emg_chan_list: # Which channels to sort, with zero indexing (can be [all] or a list of integers, e.g., [0,1,2,5,6])
        - [all] # default setting to include all channels
        #- [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] # this row defines channels to use for the second group
        #- [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31] # third group
    remove_bad_emg_chans: # false to disable, or a string for the method. Can be 'coherence+psd', 'mad', 'std', 'mad#', or 'std#', where # is the desired threshold (int/float, true defaults to 'mad5'). See spikeinterface's detect_bad_channels() method for more info.
        - false
        #- true # if true, the second group would have bad chans removed by 'mad5' method
        #- std4 # if 'std4', the third group would have bad chans removed by 'std' method with threshold 4

# Kilosort parameters
# nearest_chans and torch_device may be modified in emusort.py to avoid errors
KS:
    remove_chan_delays: true # EMUsort setting, will apply channel delays to align MUAPs based on correlation maximization
    remove_spike_outliers: true # EMUsort setting, will use HDBSCAN to remove outlier isolated spikes during initialization
    hdbscan_min_cluster_size: 20 # EMUsort setting, controls the minimum number of points needed to count as a cluster during HDBSCAN spike outlier removal. See sklearn HDBSCAN docs regarding the min_cluster_size parameter for more info.
