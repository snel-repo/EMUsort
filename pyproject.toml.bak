# old version of pyproject.toml for trying installation method prior 2025-10-16
# this is for use with micromamba, environment.yaml, and the command "pip install -e ."
# however, it would need to be renamed to remove the ".bak" to try that
# recommendation is to instead use the new installation method with uv
